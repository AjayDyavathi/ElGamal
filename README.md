# ElGamal
Implementation of ElGamal encryption scheme in python3

ElGamal is a public-key cryptosystem based on implementation of Diffie-Hellman key exchange which uses Discrete Logarithm Problem as Trapdoor function.

The code above in ElGamal_integers is for encrypting and decrytping integers only.
This is very basic implementation just to understand how ElGamal scheme works.
